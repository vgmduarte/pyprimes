# pyprimes
A simple, recursive implementation of the [sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) algorithm. 

Uses memoization for improved efficiency.

The script can find all the primes up to 1 million in about 50 seconds.

An output example is included in `primes_up_to_1000000`.
